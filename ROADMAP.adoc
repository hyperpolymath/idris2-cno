* Formal methods education

== Theory Background

=== What is a CNO?

A CNO (Certified Null Operation) is:

1. A function `f : A → A`
2. With proof `∀x ∈ A. f(x) = x`

This means CNOs are exactly the identity morphisms in the category of types.

=== Why are CNOs Useful?

* **Composition closure**: CNO composed with CNO is CNO
* **Reversibility**: Every CNO is its own inverse
* **Type-level proof**: Verification happens at compile time
* **No runtime cost**: CNOs can be optimized away

=== Mathematical Foundation

CNOs form the **trivial category**:

* Objects: Types
* Morphisms: Only identity morphisms exist
* Composition: id ∘ id = id

This is isomorphic to the discrete category on types.
